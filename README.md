IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project
This repository contains my final project for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate.
In this capstone, I take on the role of a Data Analyst for a global IT and business consulting firm tasked with identifying trends in emerging technologies and skills.

Project Overview
We analyze survey data (Stack Overflow Developer Survey subset) to answer:

What programming languages, database skills, and IDEs are in demand?

What demographic trends exist in the developer community?

How can we visualize and present these findings effectively?

Workflow & Tasks
Data Collection – Acquire datasets from APIs, web scraping, and provided CSV files.

Data Wrangling – Clean, preprocess, handle missing values, and normalize data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identify distributions, outliers, and correlations.

Data Visualization – Use charts, plots, and geospatial maps to present trends.

Dashboard Creation – Build interactive dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics & Google Looker Studio.

Presentation of Findings – Summarize insights and recommendations.
