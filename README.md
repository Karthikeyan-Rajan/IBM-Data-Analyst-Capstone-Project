# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

This repository contains my final project for the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**.  
In this capstone, I take on the role of a **Data Analyst** for a global IT and business consulting firm tasked with identifying trends in emerging technologies and skills.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
We analyze survey data (subset of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey) to answer:
- What programming languages, database skills, and IDEs are in demand?
- What demographic trends exist in the developer community?
- How can we visualize and present these findings effectively?

---

## ðŸ”„ Workflow & Tasks
1. **Data Collection** â€“ Acquire datasets from APIs, web scraping, and provided CSV files.  
2. **Data Wrangling** â€“ Clean, preprocess, handle missing values, and normalize data.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identify distributions, outliers, and correlations.  
4. **Data Visualization** â€“ Use charts, plots, and geospatial maps to present trends.  
5. **Dashboard Creation** â€“ Build interactive dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics & Google Looker Studio.  
6. **Presentation of Findings** â€“ Summarize insights and recommendations.
