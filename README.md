# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

In this project, we will assume that we have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm known for their expertise in IT solutions and their team of highly experienced IT consultants. To keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, our organization regularly analyzes industry survey data to understand technology usage trends, workforce demographics, and skill demands.

As a Data Analyst, we have been tasked with analyzing the **Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024** dataset to identify the most popular technologies, developer work preferences, and other emerging trends.

Our objectives include:
- Identifying the top programming languages, databases, and platforms used by developers.
- Analyzing employment and remote work patterns.
- Highlighting trends in career satisfaction and technology adoption.

Each step of the data analysis process is documented in separate Jupyter Notebooks within this repository, along with additional files required for understanding the workflow and results.

The process includes:
1. **Data Collection** – Obtaining the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024 dataset.  
2. **Data Wrangling** – Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding data distribution and patterns.  
4. **Data Visualization** – Creating charts and graphs to present insights.  
5. **Dashboard Creation** – Building an interactive dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics.  
6. **Presenting the Findings** – Summarizing insights and recommendations for decision-makers.  

This project is the final component of the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate** on Coursera.
